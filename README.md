# Sveltekit-Tailwind-Starter

My personal [Sveltekit, Tailwind and Netlify](https://sveltekit-tailwind-starter.netlify.app/) starter template.

<br>

## Prerequisites

Make sure that you have node and pnpm installed.

<br>

## To clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/sammi-turner/Sveltekit-Tailwind-Starter/
```

<br>

## Change to the working directory

```
cd Sveltekit-Tailwind-Starter
```

<br>

## To install node modules

```
pnpm i
```

<br>

## To run the dev server

```
pnpm run dev
```

<br>

## Netlify Deployment

Follow the instructions [in the official docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-netlify).

Make sure that everything in the project apart from the node modules is uploaded to a github repo and that the repo is properly linked on Netlify.

Note that drag-and-drop deploys do NOT work with Sveltekit, and the process is different from a deploying a plain Svelte/Vite app.
